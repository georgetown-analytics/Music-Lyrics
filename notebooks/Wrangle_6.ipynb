got me and I've got you\\nAnd with a little faith\\nMiracles come true\\n\\nAnd I don't need a hundred gifts beneath the tree\\nDon't you know the best thing you could give to me\\nNothin' else will do,\\nAll I want is you this Christmas\\n\\nI don't want the love any other girl \\nI want only thing in this whole wide world\\nNothing else will do\\nAll I want is you this Christmas\\n\\nCheek to
